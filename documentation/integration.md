To integrate this authentication component into another Node.js project, the team can follow these steps:

1. **Copy the Relevant Files**: Copy the relevant files or modules from this project to the other project. This includes all the files related to user authentication, such as the routes (`/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/logout`), the middleware (`middleware.js`), and any other related files.

2. **Install the Necessary Dependencies**: Make sure the other project has all the necessary dependencies installed. This includes `express`, `mysql2`, `dotenv`, `path`, `bcryptjs`, `jsonwebtoken`, and `cookie-parser`. They can install these using npm by running `npm install --save express mysql2 dotenv path bcryptjs jsonwebtoken cookie-parser`.

3. **Configure the Environment Variables**: If the other project doesn't already have a `.env` file, create one and add the necessary environment variables (such as `RDS_HOSTNAME`, `RDS_USERNAME`, `RDS_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`, `JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRES`).

4. **Integrate the Routes**: Add the copied routes to the other project's Express app. They can do this by adding `app.use('/auth', authRoutes);` to their main server file, where `authRoutes` is the router that contains the copied routes.

5. **Use the Middleware**: If the other project has routes that should be protected, they can use the `verifyToken` middleware to protect these routes. They can do this by adding `app.get('/protectedRoute', verifyToken, (req, res) => { /* handle request */ });` to their main server file.

6. **Test the Integration**: Finally, they should test the integration to make sure everything is working correctly. They can do this by running the other project and making sure they can register, log in, and access protected routes.

Remember, the your team will need to have Node.js and npm installed on their machines to run this project. They'll also need access to a MySQL server for the database.
